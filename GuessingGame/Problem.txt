Problem: Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. The program should provide feedback after each guess and print the number of tries needed.

Keywords
- "user has to guess" - user input
- "secret number" - Math.random function to generate a random secret number with every run
- "provide feedback" - validation check
- "print number of tries"

Possible solution
- Ask the user for input. Save it to a variable 'userInput'

- Create a while loop that checks if  'secretNumber' == 'userInput'
    - Perform 'secretNumber' - 'userInput'
        - If the result is negative - Print "Too small. Try again." & re-execute the loop
        - If the result is negative - Print "Too large. Try again." & re-execute the loop
    - Increment the counter everytime while loop is executed
    
- Create an integer variable 'numberOfTries' that saves the number of tries needed
- Print the value for 'numberOfTries'
