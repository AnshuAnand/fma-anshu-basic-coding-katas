Problem: Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.

Breakdown:
    - Create a for loop by initializing at 2024
    - Iterate the loop 20 times

Enhancement
    - Get the value for current year
    - If the value for year is divisible by 4, use the for loop to print next 20
    - If the value for year is NOT divisible by 4, 
        - find the remainder
        - subtract the remainder from 4 , and get the value, say z
        - add z to the current year. This will give the next leap year
        - set the value as initializer and iterate the loop 20 times
